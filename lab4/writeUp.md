# Task 1

    What IP address does the attack seem to be originating from?
    How can we determine what web browser the attacker is using?
    Did the attacker use any automated tools during the attack? If so, can you identify the name of the tool and its purpose?
    Which file was the attacker trying to access but couldn't due to limited server access?
    Did the attacker gain access to any confidential data? If yes, how much data was compromised?
    An important secret was compromised. Can you figure it out? Hint: The secret you're looking for is not in a .sql or a .php file.
    The attacker left a message for the server administrator. Find out what the message said, and also mention how you were able to find it.
    What were some indicators that confirmed that an attack had taken place? What were your key takeaways from this attack?
    Based on this attack, what indicators of compromise can be used to detect future attacks?
