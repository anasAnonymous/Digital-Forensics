HASHING : Hash function
ENCRYPTION : Key
ENCODIG : 


MACROS : used to write/inject code in word/powerpoint/sheet files. 
Extensions have 'm' at the end. For example # .docm , .pptm , .xlsm etc.


IOC : An Indicator of Compromise (IOC), on the other hand, is a piece of forensics data directly related to a given threat, that can be used to identify the presence of a threat in a system or a network. IOCs can be a combination of certain artifacts or a single artifact.
