Memory forensics is a crucial subfield in digital forensics, which involves acquisition and analysis of a computer's volatile memory or, in other words, the computer's RAM. The information stored in a computer's RAM can provide valuable insights into the state the system at the time of acquisition. The acquired memory is normally referred to as a memory dump, and can be particularly useful in identifying running processes, user credentials, network connections, registry keys, encryption keys, browser history, clipboard contents, and other valuable information.
